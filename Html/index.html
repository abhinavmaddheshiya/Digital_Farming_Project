   <h1>Our Initiatives</h1>
   <p>Apart from technology, there are also various government initiatives in place to support Indian farmers. For example, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme that provides financial assistance to farmers in the event of crop loss due to natural disasters or other unforeseen events.</p>

         <p>Lack of practical knowledge the farmers cant handle the machines properly. While the cost of maintenance is very high. Overuse of machines may lead to environmental damage. 
            The goal of smart farming is to produce more with less. By using technology to increase yields and reduce inputs, farmers can save money and resources while still producing high-quality crops.</p>

            Conservation of natural resources: Farming practices such as crop rotation, soil conservation, and reducing pesticide use can help conserve natural resources such as soil and water. Good clean air, exercise, quiet commune with nature and a chance to literally see and taste the fruits of your labor grow.</p>
